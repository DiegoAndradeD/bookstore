# About the Project: 

This is a website project of a bookstore done in collaboration with @Henriquehmv8. This project is built using the Express.js framework and NodeJs, along with MongoDB and EJS (for rendering).
> Warning: This project uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templating) to render pages, parameters, attributes and more. The main reason for this is that this project doesn't use a Javascript Frontend framework to handle such. This is a freshmen project and may present errors in strutcure, handling and other matters realated to coding, please consider this when navigating through our project.

This web application emulates an e-commerce platform specializing in book retail, affording users the opportunity to engage in the acquisition of diverse literary works. Within the system, individual users are afforded the facility to register and subsequently authenticate their access to personalized features encompassing favoriting and procurement of books. Administrators, vested with heightened privileges, are enabled to augment the product catalogue by incorporating new titles for sale. Users are granted the capacity to seamlessly traverse through an assortment of sections, including the individualized details pages of distinct books, dedicated category-specific sections, a personal favorites repository, and an integrated search utility.
